## Abstract
There has been an emerging interest in the study of functional brain networks in cognitive neuroscience in order to better understand brain responses 
to different stimuli. Such studies can help in understanding brain connectivity alterations that arise in neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual 
disability (ID). This research contributes to this body of knowledge by studying alterations in brain connectivity in ID compared to the typically 
developing controls (TDC). Electroencephalography (EEG) data of subjects with ID and TDC is collected through limited channel dry electrode system. 
Data was analyzed for the auditory and rest state processing along with the study of intra-network connectivity of the brain via clustering coefficients. 
Research findings indicate evidences for links between the sensory deficits and social impairment in ID individuals.
