## Abstract
This article presents a collection of electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from 14 participants, that includes 7 participants with Intellectual and Developmental Disorder (IDD) and 7 Typically Developing Controls (TDC) under resting-state and under music stimuli. The EEG data were acquired using the EMOTIV EPOC+ device that is a 14-channel dry electrode device. The article provides two types of data: (1) Raw EEG data under resting-state and with music stimuli (i.e., task based data) and (2) pre-processed EEG data under resting state and with music stimuli. Alongside this data, we provide a robust and fully automated pre-processing pipeline for EEG data. The pipeline performs filtering, line noise removal, data selection, ICA, and automatic artefact removal.
