## Abstract
This data presents a collection of EEG recordings of seven participants with Intellectual and Developmental Disorder (IDD) and seven Typically Developing Controls (TDC). 
The data is recorded while the participants observe a resting state and a soothing music stimuli. The data was collected using a high-resolution multi-channel dry-electrode 
system from EMOTIV called EPOC+. This is a 14-channel device with two reference channels and a sampling frequency of 128 Hz. The data was collected in a noise-isolated room. 
The participants were informed of the experimental procedure, related risks and were asked to keep their eyes closed throughout the experiment. The data is provided in two formats, 
(1) Raw EEG data and (2) Pre-processed and clean EEG data for both the group of participants. This data can be used to explore the functional brain connectivity of the IDD group. 
In addition, behavioral information like IQ, SQ, music apprehension and facial expressions (emotion) for IDD participants is provided in file â€œQualitativeData.xlsx".
