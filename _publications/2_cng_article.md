## Abstract
Researchers have employed hyperscanning, a technique used to simultaneously record neural activity from multiple participants, in real-world collaborations. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has used hyperscanning in Virtual Reality(VR). The aims of this study were; firstly, to replicate results of inter-brain synchronyreported in existing literature for a real world task and secondly,  to explore whether the  inter-brain  synchrony  could  be  elicited  in  a  Virtual  Environment  (VE).  This  paper reports on three pilot-studies in two different settings (real-world and VR). Paired participants performed two sessions of a finger-pointing exercise separated by a finger-tracking  exercise  during  which  their  neural  activity  was  simultaneously  recorded  by electroencephalography (EEG) hardware.  By using Phase Locking Value (PLV) analysis, VR was found to induce similar inter-brain synchrony as seen in the real-world. Further, it was observed that the finger-pointing exercise shared the same neurally activated area in both the real-world and VR. Based on these results, we infer that VR can be used to enhance inter-brain synchrony in collaborative tasks carried out in a VE. In particular, we have been able to demonstrate that changing visual perspective in VR is capable of eliciting inter-brain synchrony.  This demonstrates that VR could be an exciting platform to explore the phenomena of inter-brain synchrony further and providea deeper understanding of the neuroscience of human communication
