## Abstract
This paper reports a new dual band-stop filter structure using two cascaded right triangle with distinct capacitors in the excitation gap to ensure two resonances. 
The proposed design represents a right triangle defected ground structure (DGS) band-stop resonator analyzed by roll-off factor, effective capacitance and 
effective inductance. An appropriate equivalent parallel LC circuit model has been developed for performance analysis. A prototype operating at 0.93 GHz and 
2.44 GHz frequencies has been developed on Rogers RO4350B substrate for the demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed design. A very good agreement 
between the simulated and measured results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The design is miniature, board size of 20 × 10 mm 2 , 
and achieves a performance significantly improves the performance metrics of the DGS based dual band-stop filter reported so far.
