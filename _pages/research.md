People with neurodevelopmental disorders like Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD), Autism, ADHD, etc. have difficulties in social interaction and communication. These deficits majorly affect their lifestyle and well-being. This research work advances the idea of a potential early-life intervention strategy using contemporary classical music to alleviate the effect of such deficits. We found that the music stimulus actuates an improved neuropsychological status in individuals with IDD. This work significantly contributes to the area of rehabilitation engineering targeted for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. <br>

In medical neuroimaging, it is always not possible to acquire a large amount of data either due to logistical issues or clinical concerns of the population of interest. In turn, researchers end up with a small dataset over which statistical validation becomes a challenge. The parametric realm of statistical validation is not appropriate over such datasets due to their distribution-based assumptions and, thus, statistical analysis becomes a challenge. In this project, I proposed an innovative schematic of a permutation-based statistical framework that is built specifically from a network-neuroscience perspective to perform the statistical validation in studies with limited subject data.

## Source localization based investigation of MI
The classification of Motor Imagery (MI) tasks have been a hot topic for research in the BCI domain and assistive technologies. In this project, we diverge from the standard surface-level EEG signals feature estimation and classification and explore the potential of source localization as a metric to augment MI classification. We found the premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, postcentral gyrus (PCG), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to be the possible neurophysiological substrates of MI. We also found engagement of mirror neuron systems in MI tasks highlighted by the participation of Broadmann areas associated with the same i.e. PCG and PPC.

## A robust, fully-automated pre-processing pipeline for EEG data
EEG data, although being a popular choice of neuroimaging modality due to its many advantages, still involves some key issues that need to address before any analysis. Pre-processing is one such issue that is a challenge to handle when working with EEG data. Researchers, especially the ones without signal processing background, often struggle with this issue and are always on the lookout for simple-to-implement yet a comprehensive pre-processing method. In this work, we created a fully-automated pre-processing pipeline with filtering, line-noise removal, and automatic artifact rejection. The script is built on the EEGLAB code structure and incorporates an automated artifact rejection methodology. The entire pipeline is open-source and ready to use.

## Inter-brain synchronization in the real and virtual world using EEG hyperscanning 
Social interaction is an innate need of humans, and collaboration forms an integral part of this interaction. Researchers have been exploring the neuroscience behind the interactive brain activity in real-world scenarios using techniques like hyperscanning. With the advent of human-computer interactions, like virtual environments (VE), these collaborations can now exist remotely as well. This research work takes the first step in that direction by exploring inter-brain synchronizations in collaborative tasks in the VE and its differences with the real-world environment using EEG hyperscanning. The investigation of inter-brain synchronizations and social-cognition brain networks reported that VE could elicit synchronization between the two interacting brains similar to that of real-world engagement. The findings of this work foster the idea of remote monitoring and collaborative interactions in VEs.   

## Exploring the Neurophysiological Effects of Interacting with Facial Expressions and Controllers in Virtual Reality
The modern-day HCI applications are moving towards virtual reality (VR) that provides an immersive medium to interact with the digital world. Traditional interaction methods in VR interfaces require physical interaction through hand-held controllers. However, to offer a more immersive experience to users free from all those complicated controllers, researchers are now exploring hands-free engagement in a VR environment through Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI). These new hands-free BCI applications are largely evaluated in terms of usability and seldom in terms of neurological and physiological effects related to it. In this work, we investigate facial expressions as a hands-free BCI-based interaction medium and explore its neurophysiological effects in terms of cognitive load on the user. It is first of a kind study that highlights the neurophysiological states of the users while interacting with novel methods under the VR environment.  

## Music perception: A neuroimaging based investigation of preference, relaxation, and enjoyment
Ever wondered why we enjoy listening to the music of our choice much more than what is suggested by others? or How does our brain actuates a behavioral response when we listen to relaxing or exciting music? These are some of the questions that we are currently exploring under an exciting new neuroimaging-behavioral study.
