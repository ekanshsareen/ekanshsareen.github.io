People with neurodevelopmental disorders like Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD), Autism, ADHD, etc. have difficulties in social interaction and communication. These deficits majorly affect their lifestyle and well-being. This research work advances the idea of a potential early-life intervention strategy using contemporary classical music to alleviate the effect of such deficits. We found that the music stimulus actuates an improved neuropsychological status in individuals with IDD. This work significantly contributes to the area of rehabilitation engineering targeted for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. 

## Project-2
In medical neuroimaging it is always not possible to acquire a huge amount of data either due to logistical issues or clinical concerns of the population of interest. In turn, researchers end up with small dataset over which statistical validation becomes a challenge. The parametric realm of statistical validation is not appropriate over such datasets due to their distribution-based assumptions and thus statistical analysis becomes a challenge. In this project, I proposed an innovative schematic of a permutation-based statistical framework that is specifically built from a network-neuroscience perspective to perform the staitistical validation in studies with limited subject data.
