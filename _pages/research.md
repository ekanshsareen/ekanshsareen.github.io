People with neurodevelopmental disorders like Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD), Autism, ADHD, etc. have difficulties in social interaction and communication. These deficits majorly affect their lifestyle and well-being. This research work advances the idea of a potential early-life intervention strategy using contemporary classical music to alleviate the effect of such deficits. We found that the music stimulus actuates an improved neuropsychological status in individuals with IDD. This work significantly contributes to the area of rehabilitation engineering targeted for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. 

## Network neuroscience-inspired and permutation-based statistical framework

In medical neuroimaging, it is always not possible to acquire a large amount of data either due to logistical issues or clinical concerns of the population of interest. In turn, researchers end up with a small dataset over which statistical validation becomes a challenge. The parametric realm of statistical validation is not appropriate over such datasets due to their distribution-based assumptions and, thus, statistical analysis becomes a challenge. In this project, I proposed an innovative schematic of a permutation-based statistical framework that is built specifically from a network-neuroscience perspective to perform the statistical validation in studies with limited subject data.

## Source localization based investigation of MI
The classification of Motor Imagery (MI) tasks have been a hot topic for research in the BCI domain and assistive technologies. In this project, we diverge from the standard surface-level EEG signals feature estimation and classification and explore the potential of source localization as a metric to augment MI classification. We found the premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, postcentral gyrus (PCG), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to be the possible neurophysiological substrates of MI. We also found engagement of mirror neuron systems in MI tasks highlighted by the participation of Broadmann areas associated with the same  i.e. PCG and PPC.

## A robust, fully-automated pre-processing pipeline for EEG data
EEG data, although being a popular choice of neuroimaging modality due to its many advantages, still involves some key issues that need to address before any analysis. Pre-processing is one such issue that is a challenge to handle when working with EEG data. Researchers, especially the ones without signal processing background, often struggle with this issue and are always on the lookout for simple-to-implement yet a comprehensive pre-processing method. In this work, we created a fully-automated pre-processing pipeline with filtering, line-noise removal, and automatic artifact rejection. The script is built on the EEGLAB code structure and incorporates an automated artifact rejection methodology. The entire pipeline is open-source and ready to use.
